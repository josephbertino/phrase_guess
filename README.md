### Browser-based phrase-guessing game

Author: Joe Bertino, 2020

Play "Phrase Hunter", the browser-based word guessing game! Built with Javascript and OOP, this game offers the user a hidden phrase to be guessed by the user. The user must guess the letters that compose the phrase. If they guess five wrong letters before completing the phrase, they lose the round. Don't fear though---the user will always be offered another chance to play!

#### How to play

The program will choose a random phrase, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the gameboard. At the beginning, the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.

The player clicks an onscreen keyboard to guess letters in the phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, the gameboard displays the chosen letters on the screen. Otherwise, the player will lose a "life", represented by a heart.

A player continues to select letters until they guess the phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If the player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears. They may then re-start the game for another fun round!

A player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, the program disables that letter on the onscreen keyboard.

#### "Exceeds Expectations" CSS Customizations

1. If the player wins the round, the congratulatory message is rainbow-colored.
* I made a CSS specification for ".win > h1"

2. If the player loses the round, the message is displayed in dark red
* I made a CSS specification for ".lose > h1"

3. If the player loses the round, I changed the background color of the '#overlay' element to 'lightcoral'

4. The player can also choose letters to play by using their keyboard! Don't worry... letters that have already been guessed will be disabled on both the keybaord and the mouse UI for the remainder of the round.
